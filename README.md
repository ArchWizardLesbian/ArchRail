# Aneyh Vampirica - 
A mod for those willing to persue the Primordial Arts. Obtain Primordial jokers, Augment your jokers to fit any situation, and use Paint to give you the final kick to boost your run into the heavens.


Primordials - Powerful Jokers that all have their own ways of being found and created, discover the primordial lurking right under you.

Paint - Editions not enough for you? Paint has you covered, with a new modifier for your cards and jokers which can stack with your editions, and amp up your builds.

Augments - New consumables that can drastically alter jokers. Found a Wee Joker that you wish was useful, but are currently running a Cloud Nine deck? Put a Lever on that joker to switch it's settings up to fit your exact needs.
